# Recommendation-engine

A recommendation engine is a data filtering tool that uses machine learning algorithms to recommend the most relevant items to a specific user or customer. It works on the basis of detecting patterns in consumer behaviour data, which can be collected either implicitly or explicitly.
Netflix employs a recommendation engine to provide viewers with movie and television show recommendations. Amazon, on the other hand, uses a recommendation engine to provide product recommendations to customers. While each uses one for slightly different purposes, both aim to drive sales, increase engagement and retention, and provide more personalised customer experiences.

A recommendation engine makes use of data and machine learning technology. Data is essential in the development of a recommendation engine because it is the foundation from which patterns are derived. The more data it has, the better it will be at making relevant revenue-generating suggestions.
