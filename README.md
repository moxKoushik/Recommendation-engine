# Recommendation-engine

A recommendation engine is a data filtering tool that uses machine learning algorithms to recommend the most relevant items to a specific user or customer. It works on the basis of detecting patterns in consumer behaviour data, which can be collected either implicitly or explicitly.
Netflix employs a recommendation engine to provide viewers with movie and television show recommendations. Amazon, on the other hand, uses a recommendation engine to provide product recommendations to customers. While each uses one for slightly different purposes, both aim to drive sales, increase engagement and retention, and provide more personalised customer experiences.

A recommendation engine makes use of data and machine learning technology. Data is essential in the development of a recommendation engine because it is the foundation from which patterns are derived. The more data it has, the better it will be at making relevant revenue-generating suggestions.

The types of Recommendation engine are

Collaborative filtering-
Collaborative filtering is concerned with gathering and analysing data on user behaviour, activities, and preferences in order to predict what a person will like based on their similarities to other users.

Collaborative filtering employs a matrix-style formula to plot and calculate these similarities. One advantage of collaborative filtering is that it does not require content analysis or comprehension (products, films, books). It simply chooses which items to recommend based on what it knows about the user.

Content based filtering- 
Content-based filtering operates on the assumption that if you like one item, you will also like this other item. Algorithms use cosine and Euclidean distances to calculate the similarity of items to make recommendations based on a profile of the customer's preferences and a description of an item (genre, product type, colour, word length).

The disadvantage of content-based filtering is that the system can only recommend products or content that are similar to what the person is already buying or using. It is not permitted to recommend other types of products or content. It couldn't, for example, recommend products other than homeware if the customer had only purchased homeware.
